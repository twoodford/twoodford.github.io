abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technologies represent a cornerstone for emerging wireless
network infrastructure, and for RF sensing systems in security, health, and automotive
domains. Through a MIMO array of phased arrays with hundreds of antenna elements,
mmWave can boost wireless bit-rates to 100+ Gbps, and potentially achieve near-vision
sensing resolution. However, the lack of an experimental platform has been impeding
research in this field. This paper fills the gap with M3 (M-Cube), the first mmWave
massive MIMO software radio. M3 features a fully reconfigurable array of phased arrays,
with up to 8 RF chains and 288 antenna elements. Despite the orders of magnitude larger
antenna arrays, its cost is orders of magnitude lower, even when compared with state-of-the-art
single RF chain mmWave software radios. The key design principle behind M3 is to hijack
a low-cost commodity 802.11ad radio, separate the control path and data path inside,
regenerate the phased array control signals, and recreate the data signals using a
programmable baseband. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of
the M3 design, and its usefulness for research in mmWave massive MIMO communication
and sensing.},
