abstract = {mmWave 5G networks promise to enable a new generation of networked applications requiring
a combination of high throughput and ultra-low latency. However, in practice, mmWave
performance scales poorly for large numbers of users due to the significant overhead
required to manage the highly-directional beams. We find that we can substantially
reduce or eliminate this overhead by using out-of-band infrared measurements of the
surrounding environment generated by a LiDAR sensor. To accomplish this, we develop
a ray-tracing system that is robust to noise and other artifacts from the infrared
sensor, create a method to estimate the reflection strength from sensor data, and
finally apply this information to the multiuser beam selection process. We demonstrate
that this approach reduces beam-selection overhead by over 95% in indoor multi-user
scenarios, reducing network latency by over 80% and increasing throughput by over
2\texttimes{} in mobile scenarios.},
